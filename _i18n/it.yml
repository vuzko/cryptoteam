# Un paio di cose importanti riguardo la localizzazione.
#
# * Questo è il plugin di localizzazione:
#   https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin/
# * Nessuna tabulazione nei file yaml it/en, la gerarchia viene gestita tramite spazi
# * Usare nomi autoesplicativi per le chiavi (variabili) e inserire liberamente gerarchie
#   dove ritenuto appropriato.
# * Per le chiavi mancanti, si vedranno messaggi di errore durante la compilazione del sito.
#   I messaggi scompariranno mano a mano che verranno inserite le chiavi nei file .yml
# * Mantenere sincronizzati i file it.yml e en.yml!
# * La gerarchia Global serve per quei valori che sono distribuiti nel sito (non specifici per la ingola pagina)
#   come pulsanti link a testi esterni, ecc.
# * COME FUNZIONA
#   {% t pagina.area.nome %} <-- questo vine inserito al posto del testo nel file della pagina .html
#   t sta per testo (da localizzare tramite i file contenuti in _i18n)
#   pagina.area.nome è la gerarchia delle chiavi (variabili). Può essere più profonda di tre.
#   Esempio di come si inserisce il testo in questo file it.yml
#   pagina:
#       area:
#           nome: Testo da visualizzare nella pagina finale html

                XLT offers flexible and realistic testing of a web application's performance under load. Several different ways of composing tests allow you to choose the best way to complete a given task. 'Record &amp; Replay' mainly suits simple scenarios and basic URLs. But the power comes with Java as the scripting language, because it lets you write realistic, flexible, and data-independent scenarios.
               </p>

                <p>
                    You can deploy XLT to any number of machines, with any number of test scenarios, and any number of load profile setups. The rich reports with the opportunity to time-slice them and to group requests will highlight problems in an instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result browser provides instant feedback on the test scenario while designing it. When load testing, the result browser will give you the information you need to diagnose a problem in detail.

                            During a load test, XLT logs a large amount of data relevant to the test run. Nevertheless, sometimes it comes in handy to log additional information about the system under test. For this purpose, XLT provides custom values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The XLT report generator lets you include external data files in the report. This can be used if it’s impossible to directly access the external data source during the load test runtime.

                            title: Detailed Information About Application Errors
                        text: "<p>
                                    Imagine a long-running test and you see three errors during the execution but thousands of transactions went just fine. XLT provides deep insights into the moments when the
                                    application misbehaves.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When errors occur during load testing, the last moments of the transaction are saved, including the downloaded data and all technical details. You can thus see what was sent and received. When you use the request-ID feature of XLT, you even get a unique ID you can match against your server logs.
                                </p>
                                <p><a href=\"/demo-resultbrowser/\" target=\"_blank\">Open an example here</a>.</p>"
        verify:
            headline: Verify Everything
            lead: Assertions permit you to verify everything in detail to ensure that your test is valid.
            details:
                lead: A test is only as good as its verifications. XLT supports and encourages as much validation as possible to really make sure that the pages loaded match the expectations.
                text: <p>You can use the full syntax of assertions known from JUnit and Selenium. If you like Hamcrest, include it, XLT gives you that flexibility. XLT also provides access to all sub-requests of a page, so you can run even more detailed validations.
                    The XLT Action API allows you to include validations before and after each activity.</p>

        scalable:
            headline: Scalable
            lead: Run load tests from any number of machines, different locations, and with nearly unlimited users.
            details:
                lead: You can utilize an unlimited number of machines for your load testing. Scale up across datacenters easily. XLT orchestrates the load distribution, uploads, and downloads on its own.
                text: "<p>
                            Scale up XLT per machine by bringing up more processes for perfect hardware utilization. Scale up across machines easily by adding more locations. XLT uses differential and concurrent up- and downloads for maximum speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The load is automatically distributed across all agents. If you use heterogenous hardware, you can attach a weight to each machine to indicate a different speed or size.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Installing XLT is easy and only takes a few minutes. It leverages HTTPS and authentication for protecting your agents. Bind XLT to any port you wish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Preconfigured Amazon Web Service Images (AMIs) get you started quickly on Amazon EC2. Just start it and you are good to go.
                        </p>"

        configurable:
            headline: Configurable
            lead: Set timeouts, keep-alive, compression, image loading, permitted hosts, thinktimes, error handling, and much more.
            details:
                lead: To match the behavior with your testing needs, lots of parameters can be adjusted.
                text: "<p>
                            XLT offers a richt set of options to modify the behavior so that all kinds of different
                            configurations can be tested. For example:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Keep-alive</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Timeouts</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Content compression</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Header fields</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Thinktimes</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Content loading</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Error handling</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Maximum error count</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Permitted hosts</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>User agent</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            If XLT does not provide a property for a certain parameter, it can also be influenced programmatically.
                        </p>"
        archivable:
            headline: Archivable
            lead: Open formats for reports and results to archive them. Go back later for reanalysis. Test configurations are stored with the reports.
            details:
                lead: XLT uses open formats for results and reports. Perfectly suited for storing them anywhere.
                text: "<p>
                       Result data and reports are separated so you can easily make a decision if you want to store a lot of data or just the final outcome. Stored result data can be turned into reports anytime again on any machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reports and results store your full test configuration. Repeating the exact same run days or weeks later is a matter of seconds.
                    </p>"

        shareable:
            headline: Shareable
            lead: Test suites and configurations can be shared easily. Reports are plain HTML and perfect for quick sharing.
            details:
                lead: XLT reports are easily sharable with anyone. They are not connected to XLT anymore after they have been created.
                text: "<p>
                            All reports are plain HTML. So you can zip them up, mail them, upload them, attach them, and share them with whatever system you prefer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did you know that you can start your load test on one machine, and collect the results on another? Or maybe your co-worker can collect the data later and analyze it for you, while you're already on your way to a meeting.</p>"
